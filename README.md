Python_ESCC_course

Need to use a 2-screen setup for any online coding sessions, in fact for any online training where you are watching & writing notes..

N.B. Will jumps around a bit e.g. he will explain a concept using one dataframe, then ask students to apply the 
new concept on a previous data frame. In my notes I have tried to keep all the work on a particular dataframe close together
so the flow makes sense.
