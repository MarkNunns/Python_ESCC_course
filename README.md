Python_ESCC_course

N.B. Will jumps around a bit e.g. he will explain a concept using one dataframe, then ask students to apply the 
new concept on a previous data frame. In my notes I have tried to keep all the work on a particular dataframe close together
so the flow makes sense. This does mean that you may need to scroll down to see William's examples of the new concept,
then scroll back up to continue with the exercise given.

Will is getting better at copying code into the Teams chat, in case students haven't had time
to copy down the code corrctly. Use this. It means having a 2-screen setup for these sessions.
