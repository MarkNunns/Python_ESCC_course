    "# In this worksheet, we'll go through loops and conditionals. Loops allow us to go through things which are 'iterable' and\n",
    "# perform repeated actions on each element of the iterable. The definition for iterable is a bit circular because\n",
    "# an iterable is something we can loop over, but maybe an example will helps. We can iterate over elements in a list,\n",
    "# keys/values/items in a dictionary, rows/columns in a dataframe etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will also be looking at conditionals. Conditionals allow us to execute something based on a set of conditions.\n",
    "# To keep things simple, we'll largely be thinking of conditionals in terms of using them to make selections from dataframes,\n",
    "# and using them to determine what actions to apply in certain instances. For instance, in a dataframe of children\n",
    "# in need, we might want to select only rows where the age is above, say 16. We can do this with a conditional.\n",
    "# We might also want to make a new column to say yes if a child is over 16, and no if they are under.\n",
    "# We can use a conditional for this too.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We'll look at loops first. We start a loop using 'for', then we give a name for the iterable, this can be anything but\n",
    "# it's good practice to use something that makes sense in context as, just like the argument of a function,\n",
    "# when it's used in the loop, it will be called by the name we give it, we then use 'in' and specify what object\n",
    "# want to iterate over, and follow this up with a colon to start the loop.\n",
    "# Everything we want inside the loop should be indented, when the indent stops, the loop stops.\n",
